## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

I am using Anaconda and Jupyter notebook with Python versions 3.
Below are the libraries being used explicitly:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
sklearn
seaborn

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose Vedio Games sales dataset. 

As vedio game enthusiast,  it would be quite interesting to apply data analysis skills here and see the trend for the past years. 

My key interests would be:

1.Best selling platform
2.Publisher who made the highest sales
3.Top 10/15 publishers who made the highest sales
4.What was the genre which was most popular
5.Best year of sales
6.Game title with maximum platforms distribution

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

vgsales-12-4-2019.csv - downloaded from kaggle. 

Vedio Game Sales.ipynb - notebook where i did my analysis to find answers to my questions.



## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the [post](https://medium.com/@acharyamudumbi428/video-game-trends-the-past-bd988233b8e) available
